# Portfolio With Gatsby
This is a my portfolio. 
I used Gatsby and the back end are markdown files inside the project.
I am working with Glassmorphism. 
Glassmorphism is a trend in 2021 aobut things looking like glass.
In order to achieve this effect I used CSS.
The CSS file has the variable colors, and the variable colors for the glass effect as well.
